We can get the efficient code package for the LLCFS feature selection , so we use matlab code and get 
important features names which have more weight to decide the prediciton.

=======
This is a group project (2 member) given by professor under the subject applied machine learning. 

we use scikitlearn, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, seaborn (for initial visulization)

Due to large amount of data set, we find computational complexity on local machine, so most of the code are on Google colab platform 

Google colab is open source by google brain and you can use 24 GB RAM as well as 350 GB ROM per section, and it is easy to laod large amount of data 
from google drive and net url. 

Our prime purpose is to compare different feature selection method with individual analysis by three different type of algorithm (supervised,
Unspevised , special case tree algorithm).

We also analyze the effect of the feature selection to improve ML algorithm performance with reduce computational complexity. Parameter and 
hyper parameter tuning are integral part of modeling.
