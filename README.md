# Machine_Learning_feature_selection
Observe the improvement of machine learning algorithm after feature selection. [CFS, LLCFS, UDFS]

## objective :
Our prime purpose is to compare different feature selection method with individual analysis by three different type of algorithm (supervised, Unspevised , special case tree algorithm).
We also analyze the effect of the feature selection to improve ML algorithm performance with reduce computational complexity. Parameter and 
hyper parameter tuning are integral part of modeling

## Environment:
 Google colaboratory , MATLAB
 
 ## Algorithm: 
 KNN, Decision Tree , Support Vector Machine
 
## Feature Selection methods:
UDFS, LLCFS, CFS
 ## Language:
 Python 3.7
 
 ## Libraries:
 scikitlearn, numpy, pandas ,matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
 
 ## Flow of ML Programming:
 Read Data ----> Seperate in X and Y ----> Data Preprocessing ----> Split in Train and test set ----> UDFS/CFS/LLCFS Feature selectin ----> No of feature (consideration decision) ----> Train Decision Tree / KNN / SVM ----> Make prediction ----> Accuracy score calculation ----> 10 Fold Cross Validation ----> Measure F1 score and Result comparison.
